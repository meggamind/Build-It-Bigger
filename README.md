# Build It Bigger project Submitted for Udacity Android Nanodegree

Project 4 of Udacity's Android Nanodegree program.

# Objective

To learn the role of Gradle in building Android Apps and how to use
Gradle to manage apps of increasing complexity.
To also learn to:

* Add free and paid flavors to an app, and set up your build to share code between them
* Factor reusable functionality into a Java library
* Factor reusable Android functionality into an Android library
* Configure a multi project build to compile your libraries and app
* Use the Gradle App Engine plugin to deploy a backend
* Configure an integration test suite that runs against the local App Engine development server

# End Result



- The finished app will consist of four modules.
-- A Java library that provides jokes,
-- a Google Could Endpoints(GCE) project that serves those jokes,
-- an Android Library containing an activity for displaying jokes,
-- and an Android app that fetches jokes from the GCE module and passes them to the Android Library for display.
